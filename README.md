This project intends to map the distribution of income, education levels, and overdose deaths using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques in order to detect spatial trends and geographic patterns. The goals are to:

Determine Geographic Trends: To identify regional variances and possible hotspots, map the distribution of wealth and education levels alongside overdose deaths.

Analyze Correlations: To comprehend the links between these variables, evaluate the statistical correlations between them.

Emphasize Areas of Concern: To direct future study and policy initiatives, concentrate on areas with extreme tendencies.

Limitations: The Education Data did not contain info on all counties. Counties with missing data values were plotted as zero instead for visual augmentation.
